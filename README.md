## Project Scoping
This project explores predicting short-term stock price movements for a company, leveraging mathematical patterns in historical prices, trading volumes, and market indicators. Portfolio managers make rapid decisions every day, and the project aims to provide them with insights that could enhance decision-making by highlighting subtle market signals often missed in manual analysis. The goal is to develop a predictive model that delivers actionable outputs in a clear and interpretable way.
The primary stakeholders are portfolio managers, who make investment decisions, and quantitative analysts, who would use the model outputs to generate recommendations. The useful answer is predictive, providing probability scores, expected price changes, and visualizations of key market indicators, effectively serving as an analytical tool to support near real-time decision-making.
